Similar to the two pointers pattern, the fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at different speeds, often to identify cycles or find a specific target. The speeds of the pointers can be adjusted according to the problem statement. The two pointers pattern focuses on comparing data values, whereas the fast and slow pointers method is typically used to analyze the structure or properties of the data.

The key idea is that the pointers start at the same location and then start moving at different speeds. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves by two steps. Due to the different speeds of the pointers, this pattern is also commonly known as the Hare and Tortoise algorithm, where the Hare is the fast pointer while Tortoise is the slow pointer. If a cycle exists, the two pointers will eventually meet during traversal. This approach enables the algorithm to detect specific properties within the data structure, such as cycles, midpoints, or intersections.

To visualize this, imagine two runners on a circular track starting at the same point. With different running speeds, the faster runner will eventually overtake the slower one, illustrating how this method works to detect cycles.

Here’s a basic pseudocode template that you can adapt to your specific needs:

Sudo code:

FUNCTION fastAndSlow(dataStructure):

# initialize pointers (or indices)

fastPointer = dataStructure.start # or 0 if the data structure is an array
slowPointer = dataStructure.start # or 0 if the data structure is an array

WHILE fastPointer != null AND fastPointer.next != null: # For arrays: WHILE fastPointer < dataStructure.length AND (fastPointer + 1) < dataStructure.length:

    slowPointer = slowPointer.next
    # For arrays: slowPointer = slowPointer + 1

    fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next
    # For arrays: fastPointer = fastPointer + 2

    IF fastPointer != null AND someCondition(fastPointer, slowPointer):
      # For arrays: use someCondition(dataStructure[fastPointer], dataStructure[slowPointer]) if needed
      handleCondition(fastPointer, slowPointer)
      BREAK

# process the result

processResult(slowPointer)

# For arrays: processResult(slowPointer) might process dataStructure[slowPointer]

n the template above, the fastPointer moves at twice the speed of the slowPointer, allowing efficient traversal and detection of specific conditions. The fastPointer advances two steps at a time (fastPointer.next.next for linked lists or fastPointer + 2 for arrays), while the slowPointer moves one step at a time (slowPointer.next or slowPointer + 1). The loop continues until the fastPointer reaches the end of the structure or a condition (someCondition) is met, triggering handleCondition. Finally, the result is processed using the slowPointer, which often points to a meaningful position, such as the middle of the structure or the start of a cycle.

Does your problem match this pattern?
Yes, if the following condition is fulfilled:

Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.

In addition, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:

Cycle or intersection detection: The problem involves detecting a loop within a linked list or an array or involves finding an intersection between two linked lists or arrays.

Find the starting element of the second quantile: This means identifying the element where the second part of a divided dataset begins—like the second half, second third (tertile), or second quarter (quartile). For example, the task might ask you to find the middle element of an array or a linked list, which marks the start of the second half.

Real-world problems
Many problems in the real world use the fast and slow pointers pattern. Let’s look at some examples.

Symlink verification: Imagine you’re an IT administrator responsible for maintaining a large server. In one of the directories, multiple files and symbolic links (symlinks) are scattered around, each pointing to various files or even to other symlinks. Occasionally, a well-intentioned script or misconfiguration might create a loop—say, a symlink A points to B, and somehow B eventually links back to A. This creates a cycle where following those symlinks never ends.
In a symlink verification utility, the fast and slow pointer approach helps detect loops where symlinks endlessly reference each other. One pointer (the “tortoise”) follows links one step at a time, while the other (the “hare”) jumps two steps. If both ever land on the same file or link again, it confirms a cycle.

Compiling an object-oriented program: During compilation, each object-oriented module may depend on others, sometimes creating a loop (A depends on B, and B depends on A). With fast and slow pointers, you track dependencies step by step: the “tortoise” moves one module at a time, and the “hare” jumps two modules at a time. If they meet, there’s a cyclic dependency. This quick, space-efficient check helps catch and break these loops, ensuring a clean compilation sequence.
